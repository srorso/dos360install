This zip file contains most, but not all, of the materials needed
to build a complete DOS/360 release 26.2 system with POWER II.

This file is intended to be used with the Hercules 390 mainframe 
emulation package.

Installation instructions, background, and additional information 
can be found at:

	https://sites.google.com/site/dos360install/

In addition, you'll need the DOS/360 and POWER II installation tapes 
in AWS format.  You'll also benefit from having selected original IBM
manuals for this system.  Links for both can be  found on the web 
site noted above.  

This package has been tested using:

	Hercules 390 version 3.11, running on
	Windows 10, running on
	Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop, 
		dual-core 32-bit Intel CPU
		4GB RAM (0.5 shared with GPU)
		450GB Crucial SSD
	Telnet from a previous Windows NT system

Note: PuTTY does not play nice with Hercules 3.11
